# Dice-Simulator

We all know about dice. It’s a simple cube with numbers from 1 to 6 written on its face. But what is simulation? It is making a computer model. Thus, a dice simulator is a simple computer model that can roll a dice for us.

Conclusion Yay! We have successfully developed a cool application – Dice Rolling Simulator in Python. Now, you can just click on a button (y) and get your next number. Cheers to Python and who would have thought that we can develop an application by only the ‘random’ function of python? As of now, we have an understanding of dice rolling, Python and random function.
